# DeepContrast
Nonlinear control of adaptive optics for high contrast imaging using deep neural networks

## Prerequisites
DeepContrast makes use of [HCIPy](https://github.com/ehpor/hcipy), an open-source object-oriented framework written in Python for performing end-to-end
simulations of high-contrast imaging instruments (Por et al. 2018). Please see the link for installation instructions.  
Other libraries can be installed with  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
